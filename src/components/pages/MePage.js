                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I've come to web development from the fields of education, classical music, and business administation. After graduating PhiBetaKappa with a degree in music composition from a venerable west coast university, I settled into a day-job as a classroom music teacher, which I enjoyed and excelled at for more than a decade. Concurrently with my time as a teacher, I actively developed roles as a trumpeter, composer, and conductor with performances and affiliations throughout my local region. </p>
                <p>An administrators mindset is at my core and, in my various roles in society, I was often tapped by peers and associates to run or help run things. This led to two key positions: one in for-profit health care, and one in non-profit arts administation. In the for-profit realm, I helped to run a creative arts therapy firm with a prominent local therapist. Her company, which employed numerous professional therapists, held federal contracts to provide services at a secure government facility. My role was to generally handle all non-clinical tasks related to HR, finance (budgeting, billing, taxes, etc.), and liaisoning with government overseeers of the relevant contracts.</p>
                <p>My work as a professional trumpeter led me into the world of non-profit arts administration. After the collapse of an importand local organization, I was recruited by a top local orchestral conductor to be the business-end of a new professional orchestra. I incorportated the organization, wrote the bylaws, and establihsed a board which elected my President and hired me as Executive Direcgtor. In those roles, I obtained 501(c)(3) tax exemption, defined a 3-year plan for the group, and and oversaw successful fundraising which fully-funded the orchestra's first concert sets before passing off my roles to a permanent manager.</p>
