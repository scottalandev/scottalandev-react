    personal: "A native and life-long resident of the beautiful pacific northwestern United States, I am an avid enjoyer of the outdoors and a true lover of the region I live in. Specifically, hiking, skiing, golf, and cycling, along with landscape and wildlife photography, keep me excited to be out-of-doors. I spent more than a decade earning my primary living in the music world, and still play music every day. I live with my wife, elementary-aged son, and a sweet little runt of a cat we rescued from starvation.",
    developer: "Web development has been a natural transition for me, after numerous prior experiences of being the individual assigned to \"just figure it out\" when some technical need arose with nobody in the organization able to meet the challenge. It was by that process that I built my first several websites for organizations I was key member of. Those early sites were built with very little coding--I used squarespace, wix, and several different wordpress approaches--but I found that I really enjoyed the logical challenge and value of precision that I encountered in those experiences. When it came time for change, I engaged myself in truly learning the craft and technique of web development and am proud of my accomplishments and progress to date.",
    work: "My past experience is in the fields of music, education, and business administration. As a musician, I am an experienced symphonic brass player, composer and conductor, and I taught music in the classroom for more than ten years. As an administrator, I have experience in both the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as Executive Director of a performing arts organization and as the non-clinical administrator for boutique healthcare firm providing creative arts therapies under government contracts. Both experiences were formative and exciting. I have also worked in logistics, restaurant management and sales."
